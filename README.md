Hi, I'm Cherri, a certified business intelligence analyst with experience on more than six technical projects. My skills include business analytics, data visualization and storytelling, Python, SQL, and advanced spreadsheets. Now, I am eager to leverage my big data and visualization skills in the digital marketing or retail sales sphere to drive growth and boost sales.

Currently I am working with customer data and retail sales in my own business to increase business metrics as well but I'm looking for a full time position in the BIA world to really grow this hard skill.

Before that I spent 12 years perfecting teaching high school Spanish. My presentation/storytelling/public speaking skills are well rehearsed. As a Spanish team of teachers (large corporation), we always took a look at assessment data together to help us improve our students scores. Because of teaching, I have gained expertise in many other areas such as:  curriculum design and instructions, mentorship and coaching, adaptability and creativity, and organization and planning. 

Here are some JOB history facts about me:

- My background is 12 years of high school teaching (daily presentation skills and project management, data pulling/analyzing, large group management, curriculum mapping, and many more transferrable skills), 1.5 years of owning a business which has required me to wear many hats including pulling data to help make decisions.
- I'm currently working on another project using Python at the end of my certification with TripleTen.
- I'm currently learning new hard skills and working with real data projects from various companies with Triplten's online certifcation program.
- I am looking to particpate in outsourcing projects.
- Tech skills: SQL, advanced excel, Microsoft and Google suit skills, Python, Power BI, and Tableau.
- I'm looking for a remote job (USA).

Here are some FUN facts about me:
- I enjoy participating in professional development as it has always been a part of my life with teaching
- I love weightlifting and learning how to become healthier by making small changes every year
- My goals for 2025: land my dream job in data and purchase another company.
